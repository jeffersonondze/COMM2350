        <h3>Make It Official</h3>
        <p>
          Forget acceptance letters or your first pay stubs. You’re not an official member of the Maverick community until you have that parking e-permit. It’s a symbol of your accomplishments: I’m here. I’ve arrived. I belong here on campus.
          Okay, maybe not. But you still have to buy a parking permit if you plan to bring your vehicle to campus regularly. Lucky for you, your student or faculty/staff permit is easy to purchase. Just hop on to your MAVPark account using your Net ID and password.
